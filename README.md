# RAL-to-HEX-RGB-HSL-HWB-CMYK-NCOL-XYZ-Lab-xyY-LCh-HTML-CSS-Colorname
a list of color tones and the corresponding HEX RGB HSL HWB CMYK NCOL XYZ L*a*b* xyY LCh HTML/CSS Colorname

## infos
The hex codes used in codes.min.css are only approximations of the RAL tones. RAL tones are actually intended for solids, so it is not possible to display these tones correctly on a monitor. you can buy a color fan, color cards or other physical objects to compare RAL tones at https://www.ral-farben.de/. On this website you can also buy a fully digitized database of RAL tones as RGB values. I do not own this database, if there is a match to the official database of the company RAL gemeinn√ºtzige GmbH, this is solely due to my research, which I have done via Gemini, Google, ChatGPT and Wikipedia.

## howto use
open your css and write at the beginning of the file
```css
@import url("https://cdn.statically.io/gh/k37z3r/RAL-to-HEX-RGB-HSL-HWB-CMYK-NCOL-XYZ-Lab-xyY-LCh-HTML-CSS-Colorname/main/css/ral-tones.min.css");
```
now you can use the ral tones at your css file e.g. as background-color, background, color. write at your css code like
```css
span{
    background-color: var(--ral9005);
    color: var(--ral3033);
}
```
